"""
This is a program in which you have to input two numbers 1 and 0. If you choose 1, the order will be ascending.
If you choose 0, the order will be descending. Then you have to choose the number of rows you have to print the stars.
In the case of descending order, the number of rows you choose will be equivalent to the number of stars in the first
row. In the case of ascending order, the number of rows you choose will be equivalent to the number of stars in the last
row.
